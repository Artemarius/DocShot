    <h1>DocShot — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective date: February 15, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>DocShot is a document scanning app for Android. It uses your device's camera to detect document boundaries and produce perspective-corrected images. Your privacy is important — DocShot is designed to work entirely on your device with no data leaving your phone.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>DocShot does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>No analytics or tracking</li>
        <li>No user accounts or sign-in</li>
        <li>No network requests of any kind</li>
        <li>No advertising</li>
        <li>No third-party SDKs that collect data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Camera Access</h2>
    <p>DocShot requires camera permission to scan documents. Camera frames are processed in real-time on your device to detect document boundaries. Images are never uploaded or shared with any server. Captured and rectified images are saved only to your device's local storage (gallery) when you explicitly choose to save them.</p>

    <h2>Storage Access</h2>
    <p>On Android 9 (API 28) and below, DocShot requests write storage permission to save scanned images to your gallery. On Android 10 and above, DocShot uses the scoped MediaStore API, which does not require storage permission. Saved images remain entirely on your device.</p>

    <h2>Gallery Import</h2>
    <p>When you import a photo from your gallery, DocShot reads it locally for processing. The image is never transmitted off your device.</p>

    <h2>On-Device Processing</h2>
    <p>All image processing — edge detection, perspective correction, filtering — runs locally on your device using OpenCV. No cloud services are involved.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>DocShot does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If this privacy policy is updated, the revised version will be posted at this URL with a new effective date.</p>
